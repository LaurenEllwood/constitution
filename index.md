You may freely copy and redistribute this edition of the Constitution. (There is no copyright in the text or the layout.)

## Background

There are many versions of the South African Constitution, but the ones we have found have drawbacks: 

*	they are on odd page sizes, making printing tricky
*	they include lots of wasted space, making printing expensive
*	their layout is clumsy, often with fonts that are hard to read
*	online, they are slow and unnecessarily data-heavy
*	their layout is copyrighted, so you can't make copies legally.

We wanted to produce a better edition. 

*	The printable PDF is a standard A5 page size, which is easy to print
*	We've retained readability without wasting space.
*	We've aimed for a simple, elegant design that doesn't get in the way of just reading.
*	We've used open-licensed fonts (PT Serif and PT Sans) that are easy to read and work well in many languages.
*	We've built a web version that is fast and low-bandwidth.
*	There is no copyright in the layout. Share freely.
