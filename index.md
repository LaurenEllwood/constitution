{:.first}

*	Online, it is easy to read and uses very little bandwidth.
*	The PDF version is for printing. It's designed to be space-efficient for cheap printing, while still being easy to read.

You may freely copy and redistribute this edition of the Constitution. (There is no copyright in the text or the layout.)

## Background

There are many versions of the South African Constitution, but the ones we have found have drawbacks: 

*	they are on odd page sizes, making printing tricky
*	they include lots of wasted space, making printing expensive
*	their layout is clumsy, often with fonts that are hard to read
*	online, they are unnecessarily data-heavy and hard to read on phones
*	their layout is copyrighted, so you can't make copies legally.

We wanted to produce a better edition. 

*	A printable PDF on a standard A5 page size, which is easy to print (e.g. almost any printer can print two pages on an A4 sheet, and one folded to A5, it's easy to carry around)
*	We’ve retained readability without wasting space.
*	We’ve aimed for a simple, elegant design that doesn’t get in the way of just reading.
*	We’ve used open-licensed fonts (PT Serif and PT Sans) that are easy to read and work well in many languages.
*	We’ve built a simple web version that is fast and low-bandwidth, and works well on phones, computers, and tablets.
*	There is no copyright in the layout.
