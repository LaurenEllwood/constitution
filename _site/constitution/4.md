Mediation Committee
The Mediation Committee consists of-
nine members of the National Assembly elected by the Assembly in accordance with a procedure that is prescribed by the rules and orders of the Assembly and results in the representation of parties in substantially the same proportion that the parties are represented in the Assembly; and
one delegate from each provincial delegation in the National Council of Provinces, designated by the delegation.
The Mediation Committee has agreed on a version of a Bill, or decided a question, when that version, or one side of the question, is supported by-
at least five of the representatives of the National Assembly; and
at least five of the representatives of the National Council of Provinces.

Assent to Bills
The President must either assent to and sign a Bill passed in terms of this Chapter or, if the President has reservations about the constitutionality of the Bill, refer it back to the National Assembly for reconsideration.
The joint rules and orders must provide for the procedure for the reconsideration of a Bill by the National Assembly and the participation of the National Council of Provinces in the process.
The National Council of Provinces must participate in the reconsideration of a Bill that the President has referred back to the National Assembly if-
the President's reservations about the constitutionality of the Bill relate to a procedural matter that involves the Council; or
section 74 (1), (2) or (3) (b) or 76 was applicable in the passing of the Bill.
If, after reconsideration, a Bill fully accommodates the President's reservations, the President must assent to and sign the Bill; if not, the President must either-
assent to and sign the Bill; or
refer it to the Constitutional Court for a decision on its constitutionality.
If the Constitutional Court decides that the Bill is constitutional, the President must assent to and sign it.

Application by members of National Assembly to Constitutional Court
Members of the National Assembly may apply to the Constitutional Court for an order declaring that all or part of an Act of Parliament is unconstitutional.
An application-
must be supported by at least one third of the members of the National Assembly; and
must be made within 30 days of the date on which the President assented to and signed the Act.
The Constitutional Court may order that all or part of an Act that is the subject of an application in terms of subsection (1) has no force until the Court has decided the application if-
the interests of justice require this; and
the application has a reasonable prospect of success.
If an application is unsuccessful, and did not have a reasonable prospect of success, the Constitutional Court may order the applicants to pay costs.
