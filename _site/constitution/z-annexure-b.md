and the leaders of the participating parties, deems the appointment of
such a Minister expedient.
(2) Each party holding at least 80 seats in the National Assembly is entitled to
designate an Executive Deputy President from among the members of the
Assembly.

number of seats held by it in the National Assembly relative to the number of
seats held by the other participating parties.
(9) Cabinet portfolios must be allocated to the respective participating parties in
accordance with the following formula:

be allocated to that party.
(e) Where the application of the above formula yields a surplus not absorbed
by the number of portfolios allocated to a party, the surplus competes
with other similar surpluses accruing to another party or parties, and any
portfolio or portfolios which remain unallocated must be allocated to the
party or parties concerned in sequence of the highest surplus.

interest of good government, vary any determination under paragraph
(a), subject to subsection (9);

the Minister in question is a member; or

Minister.
(11) Subsection (10) must be implemented in the spirit embodied in the concept of
a government of national unity, and the President and the other functionaries
concerned must in the implementation of that subsection seek to achieve

subsection, the President’s decision prevails;
(b) the exercise of a power referred to in paragraph (b), (d)(i) or (e) of that
subsection affecting a person who is not a member of the President’s
party, the decision of the leader of the party of which that person is a
member prevails; and
(c) the exercise of a power referred to in paragraph (b) or (e) of that
subsection affecting a person who is a member of the President’s party,
the President’s decision prevails.

(c), the affected Ministers must vacate their portfolios but are eligible, where
applicable, for reappointment to other portfolios allocated to their respective
parties in terms of the varied determination.

(b) should it become necessary pursuant to a decision of the President
under that subsection;
(ii) appoint in respect of that portfolio a person who is not a member of the
National Assembly, as the Minister responsible for that portfolio; and
(iii) fill, if necessary, a vacancy in respect of that portfolio; or
(b) after consultation with the Executive Deputy Presidents and the
leaders of the participating parties, must terminate any appointment
under paragraph (a) if it becomes necessary for the purposes of the
Constitution or in the interest of good government.
(14) Meetings of the Cabinet must be presided over by the President, or, if the
President so instructs, by an Executive Deputy President: Provided that the
Executive Deputy Presidents preside over meetings of the Cabinet in turn
unless the exigencies of government and the spirit embodied in the concept of
a government of national unity otherwise demand.

consensus-seeking spirit embodied in the concept of a government of national
unity as well as the need for effective government.”.
