Chapter 11

Security services (ss 198-210)

Governing principles
 - The following principles govern national security in the Republic:
National security must reflect the resolve of South Africans, as individuals and as a nation, to live as equals, to live in peace and harmony, to be free from fear and want and to seek a better life.
The resolve to live in peace and harmony precludes any South African citizen from participating in armed conflict, nationally or internationally, except as provided for in terms of the Constitution or national legislation.
National security must be pursued in compliance with the law, including international law.
National security is subject to the authority of Parliament and the national executive.

Establishment, structuring and conduct of security services
The security services of the Republic consist of a single defence force, a single police service and any intelligence services established in terms of the Constitution.
The defence force is the only lawful military force in the Republic.
Other than the security services established in terms of the Constitution, armed organisations or services may be established only in terms of national legislation.
The security services must be structured and regulated by national legislation.
The security services must act, and must teach and require their members to act, in accordance with the Constitution and the law, including customary international law and international agreements binding on the Republic.
No member of any security service may obey a manifestly illegal order.
Neither the security services, nor any of their members, may, in the performance of their functions-
prejudice a political party interest that is legitimate in terms of the Constitution; or
further, in a partisan manner, any interest of a political party.
To give effect to the principles of transparency and accountability, multi-party parliamentary committees must have oversight of all security services in a manner determined by national legislation or the rules and orders of Parliament.

to monitor police conduct;
to oversee the effectiveness and efficiency of the police service, including receiving reports on the police service;
to promote good relations between the police and the community;
to assess the effectiveness of visible policing; and
to liaise with the Cabinet member responsible for policing with respect to crime and policing in the province.

vested in it by this Chapter;
assigned to it in terms of national legislation; and
allocated to it in the national policing policy.
In order to perform the functions set out in subsection (3), a province-
may investigate, or appoint a commission of inquiry into, any complaints of police inefficiency or a breakdown in relations between the police and any community; and
must make recommendations to the Cabinet member responsible for policing.
On receipt of a complaint lodged by a provincial executive, an independent police complaints body established by national legislation must investigate any alleged misconduct of, or offence committed by, a member of the police service in the province.
