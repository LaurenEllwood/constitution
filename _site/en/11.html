      <li>The resolve to live in peace and harmony precludes any South African citizen from participating in armed conflict, nationally or internationally, except as provided for in terms of the Constitution or national legislation.</li>
      <li>National security must be pursued in compliance with the law, including international law.</li>
      <li>National security is subject to the authority of Parliament and the national executive.</li>
