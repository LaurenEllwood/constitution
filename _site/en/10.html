    <ol>
      <li>A high standard of professional ethics must be promoted and maintained.</li>
      <li>Efficient, economic and effective use of resources must be promoted.</li>
      <li>Public administration must be development-oriented.</li>
      <li>Services must be provided impartially, fairly, equitably and without bias.</li>
      <li>People’s needs must be responded to, and the public must be encouraged to participate in policy-making.</li>
      <li>Public administration must be accountable.</li>
      <li>Transparency must be fostered by providing the public with timely, accessible and accurate information.</li>
      <li>Good human-resource management and career-development practices, to maximise human potential, must be cultivated.</li>
      <li>Public administration must be broadly representative of the South African people, with employment and personnel management practices based on ability, objectivity, fairness, and the need to redress the imbalances of the past to achieve broad representation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The above principles apply to—
    <ol>
      <li>administration in every sphere of government;</li>

  <li>Legislation regulating public administration may differentiate between different sectors, administrations or institutions.</li>
  <li>The nature and functions of different sectors, administrations or institutions of public administration are relevant factors to be taken into account in legislation regulating public administration.</li>
