<h2 id="status-of-municipalities">151. Status of municipalities</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The local sphere of government consists of municipalities, which must be established for the whole of the territory of the Republic.</li>
  <li>The executive and legislative authority of a municipality is vested in its Municipal Council.</li>
  <li>A municipality has the right to govern, on its own initiative, the local government affairs of its community, subject to national and provincial legislation, as provided for in the Constitution.</li>
  <li>The national or a provincial government may not compromise or impede a municipality’s ability or right to exercise its powers or perform its functions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="objects-of-local-government">152. Objects of local government</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The objects of local government are—
    <ol>
      <li>to provide democratic and accountable government for local communities;</li>
      <li>to ensure the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner;</li>
      <li>to promote social and economic development;</li>
      <li>to promote a safe and healthy environment; and</li>
      <li>to encourage the involvement of communities and community organisations in the matters of local government.</li>
    </ol>

<h2 id="municipalities-in-co-operative-government">154. Municipalities in co-operative government</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The national government and provincial governments, by legislative and other measures, must support and strengthen the capacity of municipalities to manage their own affairs, to exercise their powers and to perform their functions.</li>
  <li>Draft national or provincial legislation that affects the status, institutions, powers or functions of local government must be published for public comment before it is introduced in Parliament or a provincial legislature, in a manner that allows organised local government, municipalities and other interested persons an opportunity to make representations with regard to the draft legislation.</li>

<ol>

      <li>Category C: A municipality that has municipal executive and legislative authority in an area that includes more than one municipality.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>National legislation must define the different types of municipality that may be established within each category.</li>

      <li>establish criteria and procedures for the determination of municipal boundaries by an independent authority; and</li>
      <li>subject to section 229, make provision for an appropriate division of powers and functions between municipalities when an area has municipalities of both category B and category C. A division of powers and functions between a category B municipality and a category C municipality may differ from the division of powers and functions between another category B municipality and that category C municipality.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The legislation referred to in subsection (3) must take into account the need to provide municipal services in an equitable and sustainable manner.</li>
  <li>Provincial legislation must determine the different types of municipality to be established in the province.</li>
  <li>Each provincial government must establish municipalities in its province in a manner consistent with the legislation enacted in terms of subsections (2) and (3) and, by legislative or other measures, must—
    <ol>
      <li>provide for the monitoring and support of local government in the province; and</li>
