    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="supremacy-of-constitution">2. Supremacy of Constitution</h2>

<p>This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct inconsistent with it is invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled.</p>

<h2 id="citizenship">3. Citizenship</h2>

<ol>
  <li>There is a common South African citizenship.</li>
  <li>All citizens are–
    <ol>
      <li>equally entitled to the rights, privileges and benefits of citizenship; and</li>
      <li>equally subject to the duties and responsibilities of citizenship.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>National legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of citizenship.</li>

  <li>Recognising the historically diminished use and status of the indigenous languages of our people, the state must take practical and positive measures to elevate the status and advance the use of these languages.</li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The national government and provincial governments may use any particular official languages for the purposes of government, taking into account usage, practicality, expense, regional circumstances and the balance of the needs and preferences of the population as a whole or in the province concerned; but the national government and each provincial government must use at least two official languages.</li>
      <li>Municipalities must take into account the language usage and preferences of their residents.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The national government and provincial governments, by legislative and other measures, must regulate and monitor their use of official languages. Without detracting from the provisions of subsection (2), all official languages must enjoy parity of esteem and must be treated equitably.</li>
  <li>A Pan South African Language Board established by national legislation must–
    <ol>
      <li>promote, and create conditions for, the development and use of–
        <ol>
          <li>all official languages;</li>
          <li>the Khoi, Nama and San languages; and</li>
          <li>sign language; and</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>promote and ensure respect for–
