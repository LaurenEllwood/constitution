<p class="first">This edition of the South African Constitution has been specially created to be easy to read, print and distribute.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Online, it is easy to read and uses very little bandwidth.</li>
  <li>The PDF version is for printing. It’s designed to be space-efficient for cheap printing, while still being easy to read.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may freely copy and redistribute this edition of the Constitution. (There is no copyright in the text or the layout.)</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>There are many versions of the South African Constitution, but the ones we have found have drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are on odd page sizes, making printing tricky</li>
  <li>they include lots of wasted space, making printing expensive</li>
  <li>their layout is clumsy, often with fonts that are hard to read</li>
  <li>online, they are slow and unnecessarily data-heavy</li>
  <li>their layout is copyrighted, so you can’t make copies legally.</li>
</ul>

<p>We wanted to produce a better edition.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The printable PDF is a standard A5 page size, which is easy to print</li>
  <li>We’ve retained readability without wasting space.</li>
  <li>We’ve aimed for a simple, elegant design that doesn’t get in the way of just reading.</li>
  <li>We’ve used open-licensed fonts (PT Serif and PT Sans) that are easy to read and work well in many languages.</li>
  <li>We’ve built a web version that is fast and low-bandwidth.</li>
  <li>There is no copyright in the layout. Share freely.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have suggestions for ways to make it even better, <a href="http://electricbookworks.com/contact">let us know</a>.</p>
