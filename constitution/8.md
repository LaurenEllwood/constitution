Chapter 8

Courts and administration of justice (ss 165-180)

Judicial authority
The judicial authority of the Republic is vested in the courts.
The courts are independent and subject only to the Constitution and the law, which they must apply impartially and without fear, favour or prejudice.
No person or organ of state may interfere with the functioning of the courts.
Organs of state, through legislative and other measures, must assist and protect the courts to ensure the independence, impartiality, dignity, accessibility and effectiveness of the courts.
An order or decision issued by a court binds all persons to whom and organs of state to which it applies.
The Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and exercises responsibility over the establishment and monitoring of norms and standards for the exercise of the judicial functions of all courts.

Powers of courts in constitutional matters
When deciding a constitutional matter within its power, a court-
must declare that any law or conduct that is inconsistent with the Constitution is invalid to the extent of its inconsistency; and
may make any order that is just and equitable, including-
an order limiting the retrospective effect of the declaration of invalidity; and
an order suspending the declaration of invalidity for any period and on any conditions, to allow the competent authority to correct the defect.
The Supreme Court of Appeal, the High Court of South Africa or a court of similar status may make an order concerning the constitutional validity of an Act of Parliament, a provincial Act or any conduct of the President, but an order of constitutional invalidity has no force unless it is confirmed by the Constitutional Court.

[Sub.s 2(a) Substituted by s. 7 of Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act, 2012.]
A court which makes an order of constitutional invalidity may grant a temporary interdict or other temporary relief to a party, or may adjourn the proceedings, pending a decision of the Constitutional Court on the validity of that Act or conduct.
National legislation must provide for the referral of an order of constitutional invalidity to the Constitutional Court.
Any person or organ of state with a sufficient interest may appeal, or apply, directly to the Constitutional Court to confirm or vary an order of constitutional invalidity by a court in terms of this subsection.
