Equitable shares and allocations of revenue
An Act of Parliament must provide for-
the equitable division of revenue raised nationally among the national, provincial and local spheres of government;

any provision that must be made in respect of the national debt and other national obligations;
the needs and interests of the national government, determined by objective criteria;

developmental and other needs of provinces, local government and municipalities;
economic disparities within and among the provinces;
obligations of the provinces and municipalities in terms of national legislation;
the desirability of stable and predictable allocations of revenue shares; and
the need for flexibility in responding to emergencies or other temporary needs, and other factors based on similar objective criteria.

[Sub-s. (3) amended by s. 5 (b) of Act 61 of 2001.]

may receive other allocations from national government revenue, either conditionally or unconditionally.
Additional revenue raised by provinces or municipalities may not be deducted from their share of revenue raised nationally, or from other allocations made to them out of national government revenue. Equally, there is no obligation on the national government to compensate provinces or municipalities that do not raise revenue commensurate with their fiscal capacity and tax base.
A province's equitable share of revenue raised nationally must be transferred to the province promptly and without deduction, except when the transfer has been stopped in terms of section 216.
