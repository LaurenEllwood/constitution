(a) The national legislation deals with a matter that cannot be regulated
effectively by legislation enacted by the respective provinces individually.

(iii) national policies.
(c) The national legislation is necessary for—
(i) the maintenance of national security;
(ii) the maintenance of economic unity;

services, capital and labour;
(iv) the promotion of economic activities across provincial boundaries;
(v) the promotion of equal opportunity or equal access to government
services; or
(vi) the protection of the environment.

or the country as a whole; or
(b) impedes the implementation of national economic policy.
(4) When there is a dispute concerning whether national legislation is necessary for
a purpose set out in subsection (2)(c) and that dispute comes before a court for

legislation by the National Council of Provinces.

purposes to have been approved by the Council.

(6), it must, within 30 days of its decision, forward reasons for not approving the
law to the authority that referred the law to it.

Other conflicts
147. (1) If there is a conflict between national legislation and a provision of a provincial
constitution with regard to—
(a) a matter concerning which this Constitution specifically requires
or envisages the enactment of national legislation, the national legislation
prevails over the affected provision of the provincial constitution;
(b) national legislative intervention in terms of section 44 (2), the national
legislation prevails over the provision of the provincial constitution; or

the affected provision of the provincial constitution were provincial legislation
referred to in that section.

respect of matters within the functional areas listed in Schedule 5.
Conflicts that cannot be resolved
148. If a dispute concerning a conflict cannot be resolved by a court, the national legislation
prevails over the provincial legislation or provincial constitution.
Status of legislation that does not prevail
149. A decision by a court that legislation prevails over other legislation does not invalidate that
other legislation, but that other legislation becomes inoperative for as long as the conflict
remains.
Interpretation of conflicts
150. When considering an apparent conflict between national and provincial legislation, or
between national legislation and a provincial constitution, every court must prefer any
reasonable interpretation of the legislation or constitution that avoids a conflict, over any
alternative interpretation that results in a conflict.
